Brayden-Vidhur Processing Unit (BVPU)
Authors:Brayden Abo and Vidhur Busannagari

1. Overview
The Brayden-Vidhur Processing Unit (BVPU) is a custom-designed CPU created using Logisim-Evolution. It features a simplified but functional instruction set architecture (ISA) tailored for fundamental arithmetic operations and memory management. BVPU supports a small set of instructions, implemented in both register-to-register and register-to-immediate formats.
2. Using the Assembler
The assembler is implemented in Python and converts BVPU assembly language instructions into machine code. Here's how to use it:
2.1 Dependencies
Ensure Python is installed on your system. The assembler uses standard Python libraries and requires no external dependencies.
2.2 Assembler Usage
To assemble a program:
python assembler-1.py <input_file> <output_file>
● <input_file>: The text file containing your BVPU assembly code.
● <output_file>: The file where the assembled machine code (in hexadecimal) will be
saved.
2.3 Loading into Memory
1. Use the output of the assembler to initialize instruction memory in Logisim-Evolution.
2. The assembler generates machine code compatible with BVPU's architecture for loading
and execution.
3. CPU Architecture 3.1 Registers
  
 ● General Purpose Registers: BVPU features four general-purpose registers: X0, X1, X2, and X3.
● Usage in Assembly: Registers are directly referenced by their names (e.g., X0, X1).
3.2 Supported Functions
The BVPU supports the following instructions:
● Arithmetic Operations: Addition (ADD) and subtraction (SUB), both with register-to-register and immediate formats.
● Memory Operations: Load (LDR) and store (STR) with both immediate and register offsets.
3.3 Instruction Formats
BVPU instructions are 16 bits long and come in two formats:
1. Register Format: [Opcode][Rm][xxx][Rn][Rd]
○ Opcode: 7 bits (defines the operation type).
○ Rm: 2 bits (source register).
○ Rn: 2 bits (source register).
○ Rd: 2 bits (destination register).
2. Immediate Format: [Opcode][Imm5][Rn][Rd]
○ Opcode: 7 bits (defines the operation type).
○ Imm5: 5 bits (immediate value).
○ Rn: 2 bits (source register).
○ Rd: 2 bits (destination register).

Example:
STR X0, [X1, 4]
Binary: 0001100 00100 01 00
5. Implementation Details Instruction Encoding
The choice to use a 7-bit opcode is due to the exclusion of branching operations in our CPU, along with the support of our 2 arithmetic operations and Load / Store Instructions. The 7 bits in the opcode directly correlate to key control signals that are required to complete these 4 operations. The immediate is 5 bits, allowing unsigned values from 0 - 31 to be represented. Due to the opcode being 7 bits, and registers being 2 bits each, we chose a 5 bit immediate to keep instructions encoded in a 16 bit format.
Sequential Datapath
The BVPU employs a single-cycle sequential datapath design, integrating an ALU, register file, control unit, instruction memory, and data memory, controlled via a single clock..
